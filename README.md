Your grace, I ask the honor of a place in your kingsguard, I will be one of your seven, pledge my life to yours and keep you safe from all harm.

Rise,ser,remember that:

Night is dark and full of terriors.

Winter is coming.

Fear cuts deeper than swords.

Nothing is more hateful than failing to protect the one you love.
